done
Explanation
count=1 → Initialize a counter.

while [ $count -le 20 ] → Loop from 1 to 20.

case $count in ... esac → Branch based on the value of count.

4) → Print 4 and "bad luck from China".

9) → Print 9 and "bad luck from Japan".

17) → Print 17 and "bad luck from Italy".

* ) → Print the number for all other iterations.

((count++)) → Increment counter.

How to save and test
Save the script as:

Copy code
0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/6-superstitious_numbers
Make it executable:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x 0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/6-superstitious_numbers
Run it:

bash
Copy code
./0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing/6-superstitious_numbers
Output should be exactly:

csharp
Copy code

If you want, I can package all six scripts (for, while, until, if_9, bad_luck_8, superstitious_numbers) in ready-to-commit form that passes the auto-checker and avoids ShellCheck warnings. This will save you a lot of time.

Do you want me to do that?
